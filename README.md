## Wear Odds & Ends

Just a few quick odds & ends for Wear OS (aka Android Wear 2.0) that I wrote to improve the user experience:

* Complication that displays seconds of the minute, along with the day of week
* Empty complication with null data (prevent accidental taps on blank areas of the watch face)
* Service that will automatically detect screen off events and go back to the watch face

This code is partially based off of the [WearComplicationProvidersTestSuite](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-WearComplicationProvidersTestSuite) sample.
